Time Taken: 30 minutes

Challenges Faced & Solutions:
One challenge was dealing with the <table border="1"> attribute, which is now considered obsolete in modern HTML. 
The recommended approach is to use CSS instead. However, for this assignment, I kept the border="1" attribute to meet the basic HTML requirement. 
Another challenge was ensuring proper form structure with labels and input elements, making sure everything was well-organized. 
Overall, I resolved these by reviewing HTML documentation and practicing clean, semantic coding.
