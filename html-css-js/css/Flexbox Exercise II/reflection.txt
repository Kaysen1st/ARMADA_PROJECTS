Time Taken:
This assignment took me approximately 1-2 hours to complete, including debugging layout issues and refining the design.

Approach to the challenge:
One of the challenges I encountered was properly aligning and spacing the elements using Flexbox. 
Initially, I had some issues with justify-content and align-items inside the 
.left-panel, as the spacing wasnâ€™t distributing the boxes as expected. 
Additionally, ensuring the right layout structure while keeping it responsive required some tweaking.

How I Solved Them:
To fix the alignment issue, I applied flex-direction: column to the .left-panel and made sure there was enough gap between the elements. 
I also adjusted the padding and background color of the .left-panel to match the expected design. 
Additionally, I used border-radius for a better visual appearance and ensured consistency across sections.
