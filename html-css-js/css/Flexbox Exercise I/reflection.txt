Time Taken: 45 minutes

This challenge helped reinforce my understanding of flexbox, layout structuring, and debugging CSS issues efficiently.
Aligning <aside> and <section>: Initially, they werenâ€™t positioned correctly. 
I struggled to make them sit side by side without breaking the layout. 
The issue was resolved by using display: flex on the parent element and adjusting their widths properly.
