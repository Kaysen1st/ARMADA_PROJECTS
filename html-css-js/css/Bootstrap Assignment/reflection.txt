Reflection:
Time to Finish: 4 hours
I concentrated on replicating the Bootstrap landing page in pure CSS and HTML. 
The most critical challenge was incorporating the three-part navbar layout, especially centering the search field without compromising on alignment of the rest of the elements. 
Application of CSS Flexbox with each section having flex: 1 resolved this challenge. 
Changing to a dark mode involved selecting careful colors and handling contrast, which I managed by applying CSS variables for uniformity. 
The responsive design needed careful consideration of what to change at various breakpoints.
Overall, this project taught me more about complex layouts, theming, and responsive design principles.
